<div id="box"> <p>I thought to put together a little list with the books I've gathered over the past years and of the little technological devices I can offer. If you live in Berlin and we know each other, even just a little, you're welcome to hit me up on Instagram or through mail in case you'd like to borrow something. Just be careful, bring it back when you're done, etc. If you want to see what I'm reading, you can check out my <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/marialaurids">Storygraph profile</a> - I usually keep it pretty up-to-date. Storygraph is also a great alternative to Goodreads, which is owned by Amazon, and you can import your stats very easily from one to the other.</div>

<h3>DEVICES</H3>
<p>A dear typewriter with a red and black ribbon. A part of the pages used in 'storia di tommaso' were written with it, and all of the zine/collages text were. A little heavy, but reliable.</p>
<p>An old but perfectly functional slides projector. I've only tried in my room and I'm looking forward to having a bigger room to be able to use it more. I also have 26 volumes of Christian art with accompanying slides and a few other booklets on nativity scenes and Bruegel paintings.</p>
<p>A Lumix DMC-LX5 - it's a compact "point and shoot" camera, which means, even if you don't really know what you're doing, it's probably going to look nice, because the camera has automatic setting. It's got a lovely color setting.</P>
 
<h3>ZINES, BOOKLETS, CHAPLETS, AND SIMILAR THINGS</h3>
<p>Most of these are really cheap. Consider buying them to support the artists.</p>
