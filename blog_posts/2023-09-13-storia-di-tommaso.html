<p>Storia di Tommaso is a performative novella informed by concepts of queer temporalities that attempts a queer narrative of becoming, identity and purpose outside of the frames of linear storytelling and timelines. Set in the first part of the 20th century in South Tyrol, the story is told over three languages and perspectives of witnesses to one man's story who, during the fascist process of 'italianisation' of the land and its subsequent attack and colonisation on Ethiopia, tried to define himself across the the frames and temporalities of Christianity and Italianess. </p>
<p>The week of the exhibition had a number of events and workshops. Over the course of the it, I had two readings from the story in front of small public. The picture above is from the first one.</p>

An overhead light illuminates a desk with a typewriter and two framed pictures, one with a child playing on piano and the other with a drawing of praying hands. In front of the latter sits a candle flame, not lighted, ina  bronze holder. Next to the typewriter are pages, which could be used by visitors in conjunction with the machine. In front of the desk is a chair with a an jacket fashioned in the traditional German style, or Tracht. Next to the desk papers are hung up on a string across the wall."  style="width:80%">

<p>Installation with writing desk: candle, writing machine, writing paper, portrait and devotional image. Chair, jacket, and string from which the pages hung.

   <h3>Second cluster: Part I: Days of Halcyon / Part II: Body</h3>
   <p>Tommaso and Johannes's childhood in South Tyrol: becoming friends, growing up; the shadow of war, of decisions to be made and lived with. Adolescence, its changing of the body, comes and means different things for them. Biblical study, working on the land. There isn't much time left for hiding anymore.</p>
    <p>Account by Johannes in German, mine in English. Arranged in a tree-like pattern, growing sideways.</p>

   <div class="box"> <h3>Third cluster - Part IV: Bekehrung</h3>
   <p>Three account's of Tommaso's conversion/s, the First Miracle and the secret beginning one: Johannes as second-hand, doubtful account in German; hagiography, recorded by Agnese in Italian; Tommaso's autobiographical retelling, coming to the page for the first time.</p>
   <p>Arranged in a spiral-like movement, culminating with Tommaso's pages.</p>

     <img src="/assets/img/zine1.jpg"  class="img" alt="A collage made mostly of one piece of normal paper with typewritten text, that's been ripped on the top left corner, continuing into the top right one, to reveal a line of sky with a little moon on the left, just above the paper line, and a flame on the other corner. The text occupies the central part of the page and reads: <<You ask me about a queer weapon for the end of the world. I don't know. I don't know how to fight it. Most days (line break) I'm not even sure I want to. (line break) I'm not strong enough for the eschaton. (line break). In the meanwhile, Tommaso dreamed of an apocalypse without pain, without resurrection. The end of pain and the end of memory. I haven't been able to save him - I threw him into the war, I made him lose everything, so that he could exist. I had no other choice. He got stuck in his mind. Eternally perched over the end of the world, waiting for the dead to come back, for a dawn that will not come. (line break). And so the pilgrimage refused to end, went around in circles (line break) and so the story begins anew every day. (paragraph break) Let me try again. Come back to me>>. Below the text there is a superimposed image, stripped from a copy of a painting, showing a woman sitting on her bed, hands in her hands, looking distraught in front of a source of light that's been stripped away, along with the rest of the painting." style="width:100%">

     <img src="/assets/img/zine2.jpg" class="img" alt="A collage. The top part is made of a black and white picture of an archway upon which a picture of a young kid with their hand against the wall, peeping from behind it. Below, the text reads: <<The queer child doesnt exist. (line break). It isaan inventiion, (line break) It is (line break) It is an invention, the result of pu tting together fragments with the best possible terminology. What is queer in the child lets itself not be described. But still you go back into the nights that were, with their nameless immediacy, and you make-pretend an annunciation. But you cannot touch the child. The queer child who was not allowed queerness. Childhood feelings, eternal summer days, peeking out into the world, being alone with your desire. Thre is no name big enough for that. (line break) The queer child can only appear after its death, at a basic removal, the necessary distance for it to be safe. (line break, ink running out) How far I've had to go to find you>>. Below the text there is another scrapped piece from a painting, showing a group of dark birds against a snowy field. Over it is a scrapped picture of a young girl with a pink shirt and pink toy butterfly wings attached to her back, caught in a movement of dancing, with her eyes closed in concentration." style="width:100%">

     <img src="/assets/img/zine3.jpg" class="img" alt="A collage where a typewritten page has been scrapped, starting from the bottom, to reveal an image below it. The scrapping resembles a little the structure of a river, getting thicker towards the middle  of the page and then expanding in a like. Text is written alongside the edges and separated by the scrapping. The text reads: <<the archival impulse (scrap) the archival desire (line break) / I!ve always felt the need to (scrap) archive myself. (line break) Spotify playlists organised (line break) per month (scrap) all of the words I've (line break) ever written, / All of my Whatsaapp chats. every picture I've taken I wanted to write everything down. To hold the sum of what I am. I think it (line break) proved me (scrap) that I was there, (line break) too. Something to go (line break) back to. I wanted to make the meaning (line break)mine, to write la Recherche,(line break) the resurrection of the body (scrap, at the bottom of the void) I promised you I'd come back.>> The scrapping reveals ank ink black at the top, which then gives way into white, and below, where the scrapping becomes wider, is a screenshot of my Files directory, showing the section called 'archive'.>>" style="width:100%">
